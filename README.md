**Description**: Our task was to train and evaluate a Naive Bayesian Model that predicts the profession associated with the text of an individual's Wikipedia article. The data for training the model was that generated from part 1 of the assignment (https://github.com/wedgec/wikipedia-profession-classifier-part1) in conjunction with a resource file professions.txt that couples individuals' names to their profession(s). Mahout software is used to represent feature vectors, as well as to train the model and generate predictions. For weighting features we used TF-IDF (term frequency times inverse document frequency), and we used MapReduce to calculate term frequencies and to insert data into feature vectors. All processing was performed on one of Brandeis University's multi-machine clusters. For a more complete description and discussion of work for part 2, please refer to our report PDF.
